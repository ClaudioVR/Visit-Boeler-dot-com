# Visit Bøler.com

Loosely based on the official visitor guide website for the city of Bothenborg (Sweden), I am currently creating a mock tourist website for Bøler, a neighbourhood in Oslo (Norway). 

This has been an exercise and challenge, putting into use Materialize, jQuery plugins and a good deal of CSS to compensate for missing solutions. 

Work in progress.
